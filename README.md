# Minesweeper CLI Game

This is a simple minesweeper game I made in order to practice making a basic 
GUI using Tkinter, as well as making a package. Install in the command line
by navigating to the file folder and typing:
    
    pip3 install -e .
    
You need to have the numpy package installed on your computer.
